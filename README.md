**Market Segmentation Case Study: McDonald’s**

This case study focuses on analyzing market segments for McDonald’s to enhance strategic marketing efforts. The primary objective was to understand customer perceptions and develop targeted strategies for different market segments.

**Steps Involved:**

**Data Preparation:** 
The dataset was prepared by converting verbal responses about McDonald’s attributes into numeric binary format for effective segmentation analysis. This transformation facilitated the use of advanced clustering techniques.

**Segmentation Analysis:**
**Principal Components Analysis (PCA):** 
Used to create a perceptual map, helping to visualize how attributes are rated and grouped.
**K-Means Clustering:** 
Applied to segment the market into distinct groups based on customer perceptions. The optimal number of segments was determined using stability-based data structure analysis, identifying the four-segment solution as most effective.

**Segment Profiling:**
**Mosaic Plot:** Visualized the association between segment membership and consumer sentiment (loving or hating McDonald’s). The plot revealed distinct patterns, showing that certain segments had significantly different feelings towards McDonald’s.
**Segment Profile Plot:** Provided insights into key characteristics of each segment, helping to understand their specific needs and preferences.
Marketing Mix Customization: Developed targeted marketing strategies for each segment, such as introducing the MCSUPERBUDGET line for price-sensitive young customers (Segment 3). Adjustments in the marketing mix included changes in product features, pricing, promotion channels, and distribution methods.

**Evaluation and Monitoring:** Implemented ongoing evaluation and monitoring processes to ensure the effectiveness of the segmentation strategy. This included tracking changes in customer behavior and market conditions to adapt strategies as necessary.

**Technical Transition:**
The conversion of R code to Python was a key component of the project. This transition involved translating data processing, segmentation analysis, and visualization tasks from R to Python, allowing for better integration with other Python-based tools and improving code accessibility on GitHub. The use of Python facilitated more flexible and efficient handling of data and analysis.
